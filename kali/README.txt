5-2-13  In the process of re-writing this script in python specifically for Kali.

3-27-13  I was able to chat with Martin Bos and Muts yesterday and both confirmed that there will be NO MORE 
updates to the BackTrack repos! I am working with a couple of people to come up with a plan to transition the 
scripts to the new Kali format, but at the same time I want to maintain the original versions. I do not feel 
that everyone will be making the transition right now until more issues are ironed out.
