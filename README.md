Contributing
===================
We want to get as many tools updated from the original developer repos (Google Code or Github) as possibble.  If you 
find repo that we are currently not using, please add it to update.sh.  Also update tools.txt so that everyone can 
track what has been completed.  Make sure that any new dependecies get installed or updated as well.  This is a very 
easy project to complete, it just takes time.  We need the community's help to knock this out in a timely manner.

Support for Kali
===================
The entire project is being rewritten in python specifically for Kali.
