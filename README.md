Backtrack Scripts
===================
Automates various tools in BackTrack to give you a repeatable process and to make your life easier as a pentester.

Install & update
===================
git clone git://github.com/leebaird/backtrack-scripts.git /opt/scripts/

All scripts must be ran from this location.

Run setup.sh

Update BackTrack by using update.sh or the main menu from discover.sh.

Contributing
===================
Because the main repos are no longer being updated, I'm in the process of slowly going through each folder in 
the pentest directory and adding the corresponding Google Code or GitHub repos for each tool that I can find.
A GitHub lookups have been completed for all folders.

Support for Kali
===================
The entire project is being rewritten in python specifically for Kali.
