Automates various tools in BackTrack to give you a repeatable process and to make your life easier as a pentester.

Install & update
===================

All scripts must be ran from this location.

Run setup.sh

Contributing
===================
We want to get as many tools updated from the original developer repos (Google Code or Github) as possibble. If you 
find a repo that we are currently not using, please add it to update.sh. You will need to update tools.txt so that 
everyone can track what has been completed. Make sure that any new dependecies get installed or updated as well. This 
is an easy project to complete, it just takes time. We need the community's help to knock this out in a timely manner.

Support for Kali
===================
The entire project is being rewritten in python specifically for Kali.
